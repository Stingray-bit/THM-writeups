## Details

### Level 1: Fix Event Boundaries
In Splunk, correctly determine event boundaries, which may involve events originating from unknown devices. This step requires configuring Splunk to recognize new event patterns, potentially by modifying event boundary settings.

### Level 2: Extract Custom Fields
With defined event boundaries, the next step involves extracting key fields from the events to enable searchable attributes. Fields include:
- Username
- Country
- Source_IP
- Department
- Domain

Develop regular expressions to parse these fields from network logs. The creation of regex patterns is critical for this step and can be developed using tools like regex101 to ensure accuracy.

### Level 3: Perform Analysis on the FIXED Events
Using the newly parsed fields, perform detailed analysis on the event logs. This involves querying the parsed data in Splunk to extract insights and answer predefined questions.
